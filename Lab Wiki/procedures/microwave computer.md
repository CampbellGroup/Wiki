The microwave computer is not currently installed

~~The microwave computer is the third and least important computer in our setup. 

~~It occupies the top-right monitor of our six-monitor setup. If [[barrier]] is running, it can be accessed by moving the mouse off of the right edge of the bottom right monitor. 

~~Physically, it's located on the back of the cloud, next to our [[HP8672A]] oscillator. They keyboard and mouse are stored on top of the computer. 

~~Currently, its only job is to run the [[NI PXIe-1073]] Rf source, using the MAGIQWAVE 4083 software. This oscillator was formerly responsible for driving all of out bulk EOMS, but currently just runs our 935 EOM.
