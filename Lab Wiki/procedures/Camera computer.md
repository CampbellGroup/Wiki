The computer itself if located on the cloud, a little to the left of the [[Pulser]], and the keyboard and mouse are located up on the cloud as well. 

## List of programs
The camera computer is a Windows 10 computer that runs a few programs that don't have linux equivalents. Currently:
- The [[Wavemeter WS/7]] (the bad wavemeter)
- The [[Andor camera software]]
- The Thorlabs rotating waveplate mount
- The [[Windfreak SynthNV]]

## Startup Procedure
- If [[Barrier]] isn't running on either the main experimental control computer or the camera computer, you won't be able to use the mouse and keyboard. Grab the dedicated mouse and keyboard from up on the cloud and use those
- Start Barrier
- On the Desktop, click on `start_labrad_node` to start LabRAD on the computer
- Then click on `AndorServer` to start the camera server
- Start the SynthNV software via the start menu
- If needed, start the program for the rotating waveplate mount. It can be found in the start menu in the Thorlabs folder, and is called "ELLO"
