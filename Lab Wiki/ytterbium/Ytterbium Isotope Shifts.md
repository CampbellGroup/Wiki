A crappy table of isotope shifts that should really be improved by some enterprising individual. 

WE keep a bunch of isotope-specific transition frequencies on our wall. They are periodically updated, and the document is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E5fmUBKYx-TNP6DVRNPLjvVp5YB0T0IrQiX6IsnTt2Q/edit#heading=h.u92a3yc7kpv3)

For hyperfine constants, see [[Ytterbium Hyperfine Structure]].
For properties of many more lines, see [[Ytterbium Mega Table]]
For other shit, just look at the [NIST ASD](https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/ASD/energy1.pl?de=0&spectrum=Yb+II&submit=Retrieve+Data&units=0&format=0&output=0&page_size=15&multiplet_ordered=0&conf_out=on&term_out=on&level_out=on&unc_out=1&j_out=on&lande_out=on&perc_out=on&biblio=on&temp=)
