State detection is achieved by running the 369 nm laser with no sideband to drive transitions from $\ket{^2S_{1/2}, F=1}$ to $\ket{^2P_{1/2}, F=0}$, which will then decay and emit observable photons. Therefore if a high photon count is observed, this indicates that a transition occurred from $\ket{^2S_{1/2}, F=1}$ to $\ket{^2P_{1/2}, F=0}$, meaning our state was prepared in $\ket{^2S_{1/2}, F=1}$ (we therefore refer to this as the "bright state''). If instead a low photon count is observed, then this indicates the state was prepared in the ground state $\ket{^2S_{1/2}, F=0}$ (and we refer to this as our "dark state'').
