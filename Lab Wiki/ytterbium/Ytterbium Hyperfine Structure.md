This sheet details the hyperfine structure of various states in 171Yb and 173Yb. I (Thomas) believe that it's reasonably complete, and if you see other numbers reported you should 100% add them. 
For selected isotope shifts, see [[Ytterbium Isotope Shifts]].
For properties of many more lines, see [[Ytterbium Mega Table]]
For other shit, just look at the [NIST ASD](https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/ASD/energy1.pl?de=0&spectrum=Yb+II&submit=Retrieve+Data&units=0&format=0&output=0&page_size=15&multiplet_ordered=0&conf_out=on&term_out=on&level_out=on&unc_out=1&j_out=on&lande_out=on&perc_out=on&biblio=on&temp=)
