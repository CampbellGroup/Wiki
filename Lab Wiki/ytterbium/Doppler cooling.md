# Doppler Cooling Basic Principle
With light that is red detuned from the resonant atomic transition, atoms with higher velocities will see the light with a blue doppler shift when moving towards the light. This Doppler effect will shift the red detuned light to be on resonance with the atomic transition, but only for the atoms with high enough velocity. These higher velocity atoms then absorb a photon and have a momentum kick to slow them down. The atom then decays and excites a photon in a random direction, so that over time there is no net gain in velocity from the decay process.

## Doppler Cooling Scheme for $^{174}\mathrm{Yb}^+$
Once the $^{174}\mathrm{Yb}^+$ ion is excited from the $^2S_{1/2}$ ground state to the $^2P_{1/2}$ state by the Doppler cooling laser, there is a small (~0.5%) chance that the atom does not decay back to the ground state, but rather to the $^2D_{3/2}$ state. To get the atom back to the ground state so that Doppler cooling can continue, the 935 nm laser excites this $^2D_{3/2}$ state to the $^3[3/2]^o_{1/2}$ state, which decays back to the ground state $^2S_{1/2}$. This process is portrayed on the left side of the figure above.

## Doppler Cooling Scheme for $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$
While the description of the Doppler cooling process above is sufficient for $^{174}\mathrm{Yb}^+$, it becomes slightly more complex when considering the fine structure of energy levels, as is necessary for $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$. 
- The Doppler cooling 369 nm drives transitions from $\ket{^2S_{1/2}, F=1}$ to the $\ket{^2P_{1/2}, F=0}$ state. To drive the transitions from the $\ket{^2S_{1/2}, F=0}$ to the $\ket{^2P_{1/2}, F=1}$ state, the 369 nm laser is modulated with a frequency synthesizer by $\cong$ 14.7477 GHz. This frequency modulation is able to drive the state transition since 14.7477 GHz is equal to the sum of the energy splittings between the F = 0 and F = 1 states of $^2S_{1/2}$ and $^2P_{1/2}$ (12.6428 GHz and 2.1049 GHz, respectively).  In practice, while the 14.7477 GHz modulation can be produced by the [[Windfreak SynthHD]], we don't have an amplifier that works with it, and so the modulation applied to the 369 nm laser is at 7.374 GHz and the transition is driven by the second-order sideband.
- Similarly, the 935 nm laser also requires a modulation of 3.07 GHz when used with $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$ to drive $\ket{^2D_{3/2}, F=1}$ to  $\ket{^3[3/2]^o_{1/2}, F=0}$ transitions. These energy splittings can be seen above in the diagram of $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$ energy levels. This modulation is achieved with a fiber EOM
