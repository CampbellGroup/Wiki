MiniHorse is the optical table in the back of the lab. It contains the [[369]] laser, the [[399]] laser, and one of the [[935]] lasers. 

The 369 beampath is roughly described here:
- After an optical isolator, most of the beam power is sent to the ion table with a PBS. 
- The remainder is split with another PBS into two paths:
	- A cavity lock
	- Overlaid with the 399 and sent into a fiber to the wavemeter
