WE have 2 935nm lasers:
# 935 on MiniHorse
This is the OG 935. It is controlled by the Arroyo laser controller on top of the Toptica controller for the [[399]] laser. To turn it on, press the TEC button, wait for the temperature to settle, and then press the "laser" button. 
To adjust the wavelength, turn the knob on the right. The DAC that locks the laser to the wavemeter gives a span of about 500MHz. 

# 935 on the laser table
The 935 on the ion table is a butterfly DBR. At time of writing, it's located on a 12x12" breadboard underneath the [[760s]]. This DBR is *very* hoppy, but has an extremely wide DAC tuning range. 

To turn it on, use the TEC and diode controllers (TED200C and LDC205C)directly above where the diode is located.
