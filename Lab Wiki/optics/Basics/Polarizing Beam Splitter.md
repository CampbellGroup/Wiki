# PBS Functions and Uses
Polarizing beam splitters reflect one direction of linear polarization while transmitting an orthogonal direction of linear polarization. In conjunction with a half waveplate, the amount of light propagating in orthogonal directions out of the PBS may be adjusted by rotating the HWP. The PBS may also be used with the HWP to get a higher purity output polarization  (see [[Wave Plates]] for more about HWPs).

# PBS Mounting
Most PBS cubes have a dot on the top indicating the direction of input, transmitted, and reflected light, but reference the website it was purchased from to be sure. These PBS can be put in cages, however more often we epoxy the bottom of the cube to a small (maybe half inch) post.
