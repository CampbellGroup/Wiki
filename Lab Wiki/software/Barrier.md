Barrier is the program that lets us control the [[camera computer]], the experimental control computer, and the [[microwave computer]] using the same mouse and keyboard. 

## Startup
- first, check that Barrier isn't already running. If it is, there will be a blue and green braid icon in the top right corner of the main screen.
- If it seems to be running but isn't working, kill the process and restart the program
- When you open barrier, it should be as simple as clicking "start"
