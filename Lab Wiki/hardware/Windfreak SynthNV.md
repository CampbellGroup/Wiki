The Windfreak SynthNV is an RF oscillator that we currently use for [[Optical pumping]] in our standard scheme. 

Currently it is only controllable from the [[Camera computer]], via the SynthNV software

The Windfreak SynthNV currently feeds into the [[ADVR EOM]] via a diplexer and a low-noise amplifier, in order to apply sidebands for 171Yb optical pumping.
