The ADVR EOM is a fiber AOM designed for [[369]] nm light. Here is its response to the best of our understanding. 

A lot of the initial characterization of this EOM occurred in [[2022-01]]. 

Power at which depletion of the first sideband is achieved:

to compute the sideband structure at a given depletion power, you need to refer to the principles of EOM operation. There's a mathematica notebook in the Qsim Dropbox entitled EOM_response.nb. Below is an image that sums up most of the points of interest, with carrier depletion given at 0 dBm.
